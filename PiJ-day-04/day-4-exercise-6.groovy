//Works - All methods work using the test program at the bottom!
//Write a program in which you create and use a class called Point, with two fields of type double (e.g. x, y) and the
//following methods:
//distanceTo(Point): calculates the distance to another point.
//distanceToOrigin(): calculates the distance to the origin. Implement it by calling the first method.
//moveTo(double x, double y): changes the coordinates of this point to be the given parameters x and y.
//moveTo(Point): changes the coordinates of this point to move where the given point is.
//clone(): returns a copy of the current point with the same coordinates.
//opposite(): returns a copy of the current point with the coordinates multiplied by âˆ’1.
//Two methods in a class can have the same name (identifier) as long as their parameters are different. This is
//called method overloading and we will see more of that in the future.
